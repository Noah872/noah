                <p class="text">Hi, I'm Aliyah. I'm 17 years old and live in the Zoetermeer. Usually after school times I spend my free time working, reading books and chill with friends. I enjoy going out with friends, shopping and chilling at home reading books. if you'd like to know more about books here are some recommendations!</p>

                <p>Anyways! Enough about books. Besides reading I also like to play volleyball! I'm usually posed as a libero eat delicious foods. I love going out to eat and sort of explore new taste palettes. my favourite restaurant by far is the Gouden Wok in Den Haag (The Hague). You should really check these foods out there! They're so good</p>
